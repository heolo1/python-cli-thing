# python-cli-thing

A Python CLI thing that I am coding
I might make documentation, but this is a personal project so maybe not
It's for a game I play, feel free to use

The "main" files to pay attention to are manager.py and command.py

I think a good idea would be to add a profile class to command.py so that there aren't global _quit variables and stuff
